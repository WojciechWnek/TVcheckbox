## General info

Project built as part of self-education in JavaScript.
Main goal was to create an app with a real life demand.
Application lets user search for a certain tv show and display its data. Next it can be bookmarked as one of the following:

-   already watched
-   watching
-   to watch

After being marked, the show can be found in a profile section, which serves as an overview of a user's movie library.

## Technologies

The project was written using [Vanilla JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript) with [ES6](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/) specification. It uses [RESTful API](https://restfulapi.net/) and asynchronous JavaScript [(async/await)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) to get data from external source.

For styling the [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) is used as a [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.html) pre-processor.

Main inspiration for this app was [Forkify](https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/) project from [course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course) created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann).

Implementation wouldn't be possible without [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and its [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).
